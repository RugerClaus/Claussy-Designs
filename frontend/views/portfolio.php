        <p>Slumdweller is a metal, and neofolk band based in Salt Lake City. I designed their website which serves as an online store. I even designed a Content Management System which lets the administrator update products and tour dates on the site, using PHP and MySQL.</p>

        <p>Reina Meza is a photographer based out of Salt Lake city. She commissioned me to make this landing page which was built using ReactJS with React Router. Here you can actually use the site from Claussy Designs and see how the interface works.</p>
