                <p>I have many years of experience with HTML5. Starting when I was 12 years old and moving on since then, I have become very skilled at semantic HTML and using HTML to style my pages along with CSS.</p>
                <p>CSS is my friend and nemesis, however I am skilled enough with it to create eye popping layouts and animations.</p>
                <p>My experience with JavaScript is mostly frontend and vanilla, however I do know how to use parts of the ReactJS library, which makes designing UIs a thousand times easier!</p>
                <p>PHP is everywhere. In fact it's what's allowing the site to all be rendered on the same page! I have quite a solid understanding of PHP and I really enjoy implementing object oriented patterns.</p>
                <p>MySQL is very handy if you want to build a store, or handle large amounts of data. I have a strong understanding of SQL and use it extensively in my projects.</p>
